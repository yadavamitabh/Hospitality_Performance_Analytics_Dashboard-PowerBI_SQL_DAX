# Hospitality_Performance_Analytics_Dashboard-PowerBI_SQL_DAX
Designed an end-to-end hospitality analytics dashboard in Power BI to track revenue (₹1.71B), RevPAR, ADR, Occupancy %, Realisation %, and DSRN across cities, room classes, and properties.

Built advanced DAX measures to calculate RevPAR, ADR, utilisation (DURN), bookings (DBRN), cancellations %, and realisation %, enabling accurate operational and financial reporting.

Analyzed week-on-week trends for ADR and Occupancy to identify demand fluctuations and performance stability across time periods.

Performed property-wise and city-wise performance analysis, highlighting underperforming hotels using conditional formatting and ranking logic.

Evaluated booking platform efficiency by comparing ADR and realisation %, supporting pricing and channel optimization decisions.

Implemented interactive slicers and drill-downs (city, room class, date) to enable self-service analysis for revenue and operations teams.
